## Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales transaction data to uncover key business insights using SQL. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and advanced analytical queries. The results for each analysis task are provided as separate outputs for clarity.

**Key objectives:**
- Clean and prepare raw sales data.
- Answer business questions using SQL queries.
- Present each solution/output separately for easy understanding.
- Build a foundation for business decision-making based on data.

## How to Run

1. **Set up your database environment**  
   - Use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-compatible database.
   - Import the provided dataset from the `data/` folder.

2. **Run analysis scripts**  
   - Navigate to the `queries/` folder.
   - Execute each SQL script as per instructions.
   - Each script produces a distinct output, saved in the `outputs/` folder or displayed on your SQL client.

3. **Review outputs**  
   - All results are provided as separate outputs for each analysis.
   - Use the outputs for reporting or further analysis.

## Analysis Outputs

Each business question or analytical goal is addressed with a separate SQL script and corresponding output file.  
**Examples:**
- **Total Sales by Month:**  
  `outputs/total_sales_by_month.csv`
- **Top Selling Products:**  
  `outputs/top_selling_products.csv`
- **Sales by Store Location:**  
  `outputs/sales_by_location.csv`
- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  `outputs/customer_segments.csv`

*You may add/modify outputs according to your specific analyses.*
